  <p>There are a number ways to keep your crypto safe. In fact, there are so many different types of storage that choosing one way can be overwhelming. Do not fret — this guide will help you understand how crypto is stored, and more importantly, which option is best for you!</p>
  <h2>What is a wallet?</h2>
  <p>Let’s begin by breaking down the concept of a wallet. Simply put, a wallet is a place where you can send, store, and receive different cryptocurrency. Wallets function through the use of public and private keys.</p>
  <ul>
  <li>A public key is the address that anyone can use to send you money.</li>
  <li>A private key is what you use to send money to others.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Essentially, your private key is what keeps your cryptocurrency secure. Only you should have access to your private key. It cannot be stressed enough that you must never lose your private key! If you want to avoid losing all of your crypto, it is important for you keep your private key not only somewhere safe, but somewhere you are sure to remember.</p>
  <h2>Hot vs Cold Storage</h2>
  <p>The main difference between hot and cold storage is that the former is connected to the internet, while the latter is not. Hot storage allows crypto to be easily accessible, kind of like the wallet in your pocket allows you to use your money at any time. This type of storage is recommended if you intend to use your crypto for payment, trading, or investing. With hot storage, there is always the risk that your crypto can be hacked.</p>
  <p>Cold storage, on the other hand, does not have this risk, though it does not allow easy access to your money. This type of storage is best suited for those who want to buy crypto and hold it in the long term, keeping crypto safe and away from any internet connection.</p>
  <p>When it comes to understanding crypto, it helps to draw from real life examples. The most common analogy to hot and cold storage is the idea of a checking account and savings account. Like a checking account, Hot wallets allow you to spend your cryptocurrency, while cold wallets let you keep it stored for the long haul, the same way a savings account holds your money.</p>
  <h2>Hot storage types:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Online wallets or storing your crypto on an exchange</li>
  <li>Desktop/mobile wallets</li>
  <li>Multi-signature wallets</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Need to know</b>: Perhaps the biggest advantage of a hot wallet is that it allows your crypto to be easily acccesible and facilitate the instant transfer of funds. However, because they are connected to the iternet, they are more susceptible to hacks.</p>
  <h2>Cold storage types:</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Paper wallet – all of your information on a piece of paper, such as a QR code</li>
  <li>Hardware wallet – a physical device where you can store your crypto, typically USB-sized</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Need to know</b>: One advantage of cold wallets is that you could potentially recover a lost key, depending on what type of wallet you have. The fact that they remain offline also provides an extra layer of security. At the same time, cold wallets are rather expensive, and they are not convenient if you plan to use your crypto for micro-transactions.</p>
  <h2>Important tips to keep in mind</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Do not give anyone your private key</li>
  <li>Use cold wallets for crypto you don’t plan on using for a while</li>
  <li>Use hardware wallets that are protected by PIN or password</li>
  <li>Understand the risks associated with hot storage</li>
  <li>Kept your crypto stored in whatever way works best for your planned usage</li>
  </ul>
