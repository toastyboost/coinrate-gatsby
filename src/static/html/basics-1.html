<div class="Article__content"><p>Commonly referred to as ICOs, an initial coin offering is a way for crypto or blockchain projects to raise money by creation of a cryptocurrency. Typically, a project releases a certain number of its underlying tokens and offers them for sale in exchange for Bitcoin, Ethereum or fiat money. ICOs have been compared to IPOs (initial public offerings), though they contain key differences.</p>

  <p>If you are interested in learning more about the history of ICOs, look no further!</p>
  <h2>1. How ICOs got started</h2>
  <p>The first ICO was launched by Mastercoin, which managed to raise $5 million worth of Bitcoin in 2013. The model was adopted by other crypto projects in the years that followed. Ethereum, for example, secured almost $20 million in its ICO back in 2014.</p>
  <p>Before conducting an ICO, most projects release a document outlining a particular problem and how the company’s product will solve it. This document is known as a white paper. Usually, the white paper also includes information about the team behind the product, token implementation, and a detailed plan for the future.</p>
  <h2>2. ICOs exploded in 2017</h2>
  <p>2017 was the year of the ICO. New projects began launching ICOs left and right. The total amount secured by ICOs last year is estimated to be over $4 billion. Until recently, Filecoin held the title as the highest-earning ICO of all time, raising $257 million in August. That record was beaten by Telegram, which raised $850 million in a pre-ICO sale for its blockchain platform, the Telegram Open Network, in February 2018.</p>

  <p>Though many ICOs have proven successful, others have found themselves at the center of controversy, such as Tezos. The self-governing blockchain protocol raised $232 million in July, but became plagued with lawsuits, causing the project to come to a halt. Those who were promised tokens received nothing at all, leading many to call Tezos a scam.</p>
  <p>In the past few months, “pump-and-dump” schemes have become increasingly popular. These are scams where ICOs promise investors that their token will skyrocket in value, persuading them to buy as many as possible. However, once a sale is completed, the project dumps all of the coins onto the market, leaving investors with worthless coins. Projects then disappear, removing traces of their existence such as by deleting websites. Due to these reasons, ICOs have fallen under intense scrutiny in 2018.</p>
  <h2>3. ICOs face increasing regulation</h2>
  <p>Regulatory bodies including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in the United States have called for more regulation in the sphere of ICOs, citing investor protection as a major issue. Unlike IPOs, ICOs are not held to any regulatory framework. Moreover, whereas IPOs offer dividends from company profit, all ICOs offer are tokens that may or may not rise in value in the future.</p>

  <p>A growing number of scams have led many regulators to take it upon themselves to inform investors of the risks associated with ICOs. Some governments, including China and South Korea, have banned ICOs altogether. Though there is currently no global standard of regulation, governments are approaching ICOs with increased caution. Many believe 2018 will become the year of ICO regulation.</p>
  <h2>4. Do your own research</h2>
  <p>The past few years have shown that ICO investments can indeed be profitable, but it is imperative to understand how they work. Given that there are definitely risks associated with ICOs, researching the project you are interested in and reading through its white paper is highly recommended, if not necessary. Moreover, it is wise to keep an eye open for scams at all times. These are the essential basics to understanding initial coin offerings at present.</p>
