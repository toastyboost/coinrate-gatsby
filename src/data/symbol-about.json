ETH is the native currency for the Ethereum platform and also works as the transaction fees to miners on the Ethereum network.,Ethereum is the pioneer for blockchain based smart contracts. When running on the blockchain a smart contract becomes like a self-operating computer program that automatically executes when specific conditions are met. On the blockchain, smart contracts allow for code to be run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference. It can facilitate the exchange of money, content, property, shares, or anything of value. The Ethereum network went live on July 30th, 2015 with 72 million Ethereum premined."

Key features include:,- Infinity Nodes to allow for the instantaneous sending of SIN coins, which is carried out through FlashSend. Users will have the option to send their SINOVATE coins anonymously, via a feature known as ShadowSend.,- Revolving Sovereignty Votes(RSV) aims to offer the most decentralized E-Governance voting system. Those who want to vote must keep having new nodes whenever their maturity date is reached. IDS, which will allow users to send encrypted data anonymously, will eventually be implemented.,- Infinity Nodes and the coins that are set up for nodes will be removed from the circulating supply to control inflation whilst continuing to support, validate and secure the network. The incentive rate received is dependent on the number of locked in an Infinity Node. All Infinity Nodes will have a theoretical life of 12 months, at which point they will be removed from the node count. Infinity Nodes will create more nodes for the SIN Blockchain and fewer coins in the circulating supply."

Staking, incentivized through interest payments, validates transactions on the VeriCoin network.,VeriCoin transactions are reportedly nearly instant (currently 10 times faster than Bitcoin). The team claims that -- upon the upcoming launch of the binary chain that pairs VeriCoin with Verium Reserve -- network transaction speeds will increase exponentially. The Dual Blockchain (or Binary-Chain) pairs a digital currency (VeriCoin) with a digital reserve (Verium). It reportedly secures and accelerates transactions by leveraging complementary protocol technologies (Proof-of-Stake-Time and Proof-of-Work-Time), into a blockchain system. The goal is to offer a comprehensive solution to ensure low cost, secure, fast, and scalable digital transactions."

Anonymous) describes itself as a cryptocurrency with privacy and masternode features that aims to build upon Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency technologies. The team includes Jake Greenbaum (Jake the CryptoKing) as its founder and advisors such as Steven Nerayoff, Eli Blatt, and Ran Neu-Ner. Similar to cash, ANON reportedly allows the payer and payee to remain anonymous while transacting - Users can selectively anonymize transactions that are made over the network using zk-SNARKs.,According to the team, ANON's shielded addresses keep balances and transactions private and untrackable. Balances and transactions can also be made transparent by using the unshielded addresses. This allows the network to maintain a secure ledger of balances without disclosing the users or amounts involved. Instead of publishing spend-authority and transaction values, the transaction metadata is encrypted and zk-SNARKs are used to prove the integrity of balances and coin supply.,ANON rewards its masternode operators with a portion of the block rewards and allows operators voting rights on community-raised proposals. Proposals can be made by anyone upon payment of 100 ANON, and once passed, these proposals direct the payment of superblocks to fund tertiary initiatives. Although developmental pathing decisions rest with the team, the community is able to directly influence the project via the proposals and voting process.Following the coin-burn in January 2019, there will be a maximum of 20,228,644 ANON that will ever exist, making it a deflationary currency.

The protocol differs from traditional blockchain consensus as transactions are not treated in batches, but asynchronously processed within shards, with the overall state of the network verified and validated at the end of each epoch (each epoch having a random timeframe). The network will also feature a Turing complete scripting language that will allow developers to build and run zApps, create digital assets, and allow low-resource devices to participate in the network."
